# Upgrades

## v0.10.0

1. Log into your node.

2. Create the new directory for v0.10.0:

```console
mkdir -p "${HOME}"/.sifnoded/cosmovisor/upgrades/0.10.0/bin
```

3. Download the upgrade:

```console
cd "${HOME}"/.sifnoded/cosmovisor/upgrades/0.10.0/bin
wget -O sifchain.zip https://github.com/Sifchain/sifnode/releases/download/v0.10.0/sifnoded-v0.10.0-linux-amd64.zip
```

4. Verify the upgrade:

```console
sha256sum sifchain.zip
```

and it should equal `56b564f3317234c52f8d4427073f48528362fadf888d2bb2397317d6c70965e7`

5. Unzip:

```console
unzip sifchain.zip
```

Once the block height is reached, your node will automatically switch to `v0.10.0`. However, if your node has already halted (you're performing the above steps _after_ the height has already been reached), then simply restart your node once you've completed the above.
